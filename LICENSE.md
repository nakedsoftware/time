## FAQ

### Why Are You Making the Source Code for Naked Time Available?

Naked Time is a product that we are proud of. But it's not just the finish product that we're proud of. We're proud of the work and craftsmanship that goes into the source code for the product. We're so proud of the source code, that we want to share it with others to see.

Traditionally, there have been two models for software development: open source and closed source. There are many great and wonderful open source products, and we use many of them ourselves within Naked Time or used by Naked Time. Closed source companies are the traditional vendors of software applications and customers don't get to see the internal workings of the product.

Naked Software, LLC, wanted to go in a hybrid direction. We obviously want to make money from people using our products as we have a business that we want to grow, we want to provide for ourselves and our families, and we want to hire people in the future and provide for them and their families. But we also want to make our source code open and available to our customers to customize and use, and we can't really come up with a good reason why we should keep our source code hidden or secret.

Naked Software, LLC, also believes that there is value in the source code for students who are learning about software development, and other professionals who are looking to grow their skills or building products that we, ourselves, may use. Our architectural decisions may inspire others to follow our path (or not to, which is valid as well). They way that we implement, build, and deploy our software may inspire the development of future wonderful products and services by others.

It's also just as likely that we'll get hate mail and criticism for our software and our source code, but we're willing to take that. Our source code and the Naked Time product is not set in stone and will constantly evolve and get better (or occasionally worse). What's important is that our best work is always going to come tomorrow, sometimes good features have shaky code behind them, but there's always another day to learn more and come back and make something better.

Another reason for making the source code available is that we believe that having the source code open and reviewable with others will open opportunities for collaboration and community building with other software developers and companies. By making the source code available for how Naked Time works, other independent developers or companies can collaborate with us on building new feature or improving existing features. Other developers and businesses can also create complimentary products that integrate with Naked Time, providing even more value for our customers.

Our licensing approach is inspired by [Fair-code](https://faircode.io), minus the rights to free use of our product. We make the source code visible and accessible to anyone for non-commercial use, and we give our customers the right to fork and customize our source code for their own purposes. The only change is that use of our software in a commercial production setting requires purchasing a valid commercial product license and keeping the license active.

### I developed a new feature for Naked Time using the source code. How can I contribute it back to the product?

Naked Software encourages individual software developers or business customers to customize the Naked Time product to fit their needs. While we will accept bug fixes that have gone through a code review process, we are unable to accept feature contributions at this time. Instead, we encourage you to submit new feature ideas to us either using the [Discussions](https://github.com/nakedsoftware/time/discussions) forum on GitHub or creating a feature request as an [issue](https://github.com/nakedsoftware/time/issues) on the [Naked Time repository](https://github.com/nakedsoftware/time).

We appreciate your willingness to build and contribute a new feature. Given that Naked Time is not an open source product and not licensed under an compatible [open source license](https://opensource.org/licenses), Naked Software, LLC, is unable to accept new feature contributions from customers or third-parties due to intellectual property, licensing, and ownership concerns. However, we would be extremely happy to receive your feedback and collaborate with you on the implementation of the new feature if we feel that it fits into our scope and vision for the Naked Time product.
